The Story Experience Team reached out to me for a five month contract to prepare for the release of Meow Wolf Denver.

_January, 2021—March, 2021_

Little Ocotillo was a pop-up community in Phoenix, AZ. The project was a month-long activation and proof-of-concept for Culdesac, a real estate startup building a neighborhood for residents without cars. I was asked to envision Culdesac's car-free ideals as a pop-up eco-village where residents could try out the "car-free lifestyle" in person.

- I was given full discretion over quarter-million dollar budget

- I designed the Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that was the central interactive tie-in to the episodic film release, _I Dared My Best Friend to Ruin My Life_
- I worked with a dozen other creatives and game designers to integrate their work into the ARG, building out a deep and fractally-nested world
- I dramatized the use of Tor, public-key cryptography, face/emotion tracking, realistic password cracking, etc. to make the participant feel like a real hacker

The World Expo Dubai is the first world’s fair to be held in the Middle East. Magnopus created an exact digital replica of the Expo and populated it with characters and quests that bring to life the history and culture of the region. Our project was a nonlinear, site-specific adventure game that could be experienced across VR, AR, and RR (real reality).

- I designed quests that took advantage of the unique technologies available (AR, VR, Google Cloud Anchors, onsite physical interactions, etc)
